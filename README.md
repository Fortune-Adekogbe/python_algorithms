## Algorithms and data structures implemented in Python 3

- graphs and graph search algorithms
- sorts
- search data structures
- lists, stacks, queues
- some other algorithms and types

I am working on tests and assets for these files. Unit tests are in the `tests` directory, and some modules have doc tests. Some data structures make assertions or have methods for making assertions that check invariants.

#### Unit tests
`python -m unittest discover tests -v`

#### Doc tests
`python <module.py> -v`
